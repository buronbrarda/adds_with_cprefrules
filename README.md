# Argumentation-Based Multi-Criteria Decision Support System with Conditional Preference Rules

This project is an implementation of a research line carried out by Martin E. Buron Brarda, Luciano H. Tamargo and Alejandro J. Garc√≠a, all of them integrants of the Institute for Computer Science and Engineering (ICIC, UNS-CONICET).

The application contains two main modules: An interface for the users (developed in Java) and the application core (developed in SWI-Prolog). So, for running our application you will need to install the Java Virtual Machine and the SWI-Prolog interpreter into your computer. You can download the Jave Runtime Environment 8 (64 bits) or superior from: https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp. SWI-Prolog 7.6.0 (64 bits) or superior can be downloaded from: http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/devel.

We have tested our application only on machines running Windows. However, since all the the code that we have developed is excuted via-interpreter, none major problems should appear for running our application in different operative systems (Linux, MAC OS, etc.). You can download the whole code, or just download the application that was built for Windows x64.

Also, for runnig our application in Windows it is required to have the local path for SWI-Prolog interprer added as a Global Path Variable. In the following link, there is an instrucction manual to do this: https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/features/test-runners/add-path-environment-variables.

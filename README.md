# Argumentation Based Decision Support System with Conditional Preference Rules

This project is an implementation of a research line carried out by Alejandro J. Garc√≠a, Luciano H. Tamargo and Martin E. Buron Brarda, all of them integrants of the Institute for Computer Science and Engineering (ICIC, UNS-CONICET).

The application contains two main modules: An interface for the users (developed in Java) and the application core (developed in SWI-Prolog). So, for running our application you will need to instal the Java Virtual Machine and the SWI-Prolog interpreter into your computer.

We have tested our application only on machines running Windows. However, since all the the code that we have developed is excuted by an interpreter, none major problems should appear for running our application in different operative systems (Linux, MAC OS, etc.).

For runnig our application in Windows it is required to have the local path for SWI-Prolog interprer added as a Global Path Variable.
